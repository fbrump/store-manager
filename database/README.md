# Database

Last, but not least, the database. In this section, I want to keep everything related to database on the project.

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) - *MariaDB Server is one of the most popular open source relational databases. Itâ€™s made by the original developers of MySQL and guaranteed to stay open source. It is part of most cloud offerings and the default in most Linux distributions.*
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) - SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite is the most used database engine in the world. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications that people use every day.
