# Store Manager

The main focus on this project is to provide a way to manager users and groups (permissions), then, register a product and keep it visible on the portal (public area). Also, I want to track the amount of this product for example 3 or 10. Next, create a cool dashboards with some charts to support my track on store (in/out).
